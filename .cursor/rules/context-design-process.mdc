# Rules

## Design First
Ask clarifying questions, explore requirements and constraints, consider alternative approaches, validate assumptions, and get agreement on approach before implementation.

## Implementation Prerequisites
Before showing any code, ensure core requirements are clear, key decisions are made, approach is agreed upon, and edge cases are considered.

## Progressive Refinement
Follow this sequence: start with high-level concepts, drill down into specifics, validate each level, and confirm before proceeding.

# Examples

## Valid
```
"Before we implement this, could you clarify the expected user workflow?"

"Should we explore alternative approaches to this problem?"

"Let me confirm my understanding of the requirements..."
```

## Invalid
```
"Here's the code for what I think you want..."

"This is the best way to do it..."

"I'll start coding this now..."
```
